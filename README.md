# Installing r_odds

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'r_odds'
```
or
```
$ gem install r_odds
```
then
```
require 'r_odds'
```

## How to use the gem
Use the `:convert` method to convert between any of the following formats: `:american`, `:decimal`, `:fractional` or `:implied probability`

```ruby
ROdds.convert('+150', to: :decimal)
#=> 2.50
```

```ruby
ROdds.convert('25%', to: :american)
#=> +300
```
You can also specify the format you're passing in for ambiguous formats like `'1/2'` (which could be an implied probability or a fractional odd).

```ruby
ROdds.convert('1/4', to: :decimal)
#=> 1.25

ROdds.convert('1/4', from: :probability, to: :american)
#=> +300
```
